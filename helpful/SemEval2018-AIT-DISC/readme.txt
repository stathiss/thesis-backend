SemEval-2018 Affect in Tweets DIstant Supervision Corpus (SemEval-2018 AIT DISC)
================================================================================

This corpus was collected by polling the Twitter API for tweets that included emotion-related words
such as '#angry', 'annoyed', 'panic', 'happy', 'elated', 'surprised', etc. The full list of query
terms will be made available February 2018.

The AIT DISC is distributed via tweet IDs. You can download the tweets using the provided script.
Please note that due to Twitter's limits it takes several days to download the corpus. Also, some
tweets may be unavailable if their authors have deleted the tweets.  The current release includes
IDs for English tweets. Soon, we will make similar ID files available for Arabic and Spanish as well.

Semeval Twitter Data Download Script
------------------------------------

The download script has been adapted from Alan Ritter's script: https://github.com/aritter/twitter_download.
The tweets ids must be in a file with the following format: one tweet ID per line. 

Prerequisites:
--------------
[sixohsix/twitter](https://github.com/sixohsix/twitter)

```
easy_install twitter
```

Usage:
------

The first time you run this, it should open up a web browser, have you log into Twitter, and show a PIN number for you to enter into a prompt generated by the script.

1. Login to Twitter with your user name in your *default* browser.

2. Run the script like this to download your credentials: `python download_tweets_api.py --dist=SemEval2018-AIT-DISC.txt --output=SemEval2018-AIT-DISC-tweets.txt`

3. Download tweets like so: 
```
python download_tweets_api.py --dist=SemEval2018-AIT-DISC.txt --output=SemEval2018-AIT-DISC-tweets.txt
```


Restarting after a partial download:
------------------------------------
In case the script hangs in the middle of the download for whatever reason, use the --partial argument to specify the file containing partially downloaded results.  
This way you won't have to start from scratch again:

```
python download_tweets_api.py --dist=SemEval2018-AIT-DISC.txt --partial=SemEval2018-AIT-DISC-tweets.txt --output=SemEval2018-AIT-DISC-tweets2.txt
```


Notes:
------
- You may need to manually change the link that is printed out for authorization to use https:// instead of http://
- The time on your computer needs to be set accurately.  Thanks to Canberk for noting this on the email list.
